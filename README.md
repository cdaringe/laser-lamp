# build instruction
- wire similarly to the [kerf](http://www.instructables.com/id/Kerf-Table-Lamp/) instructable.  it's electronically (functionally, not component-wise) ~the same, except the physical board layout is different. we will use a breadboard, they used a board they made themselves.  wire it up the same regardless, disregarding physical layout.
- observe build progression in blog post, and follow!

# bill of material
- LM7805, 5V regulator [here](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dindustrial&field-keywords=lm7805&rh=n%3A16310091%2Ck%3Alm7805)
- mini breadboard, [here](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dindustrial&field-keywords=Mini+Breadboard)
- 12V power supply, [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VM28NWW?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00).  I used rockbirds brand.  The molex connector is super handy!
- ATMEL ATTINY45, [here](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dcomputers&field-keywords=ATMEL+ATTINY45)
- 12V G4 LED panel.  [superbrightleds.com](https://www.superbrightleds.com/) has a wide selection.  just search "G4" and pick your pref.  I used [this one](moreinfo/landscape-bulbs/g4-led-bulb-9-smd-led-bi-pin-led-disc-lan/2696/)
- HC-SR04
- 2x 120 Ohm resistors
- npn transistor, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N2222)
- lots of wire, general purpose electronics
- some glue (not required, but recommended)
